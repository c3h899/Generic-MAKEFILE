# Generic-MAKEFILE
Generic MAKEFILE intended as a C/CPP software development quick start. The full GNU configuration (Configure) stack is not implemented, limiting the applicability of this script to modern systems such the x86-64 architecture used in desktop computers. The script is configured to employ recursive find and linking of source files. The project is intended to offer a means of quickly and easily getting started on a software project, particularly as a starting developer, without having to lean/configure the full GNU toolchain as a prerequisite.
